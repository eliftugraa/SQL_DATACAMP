Begin by selecting all columns from the cities table, using the SQL shortcut that selects all.

SELECT * FROM cities;

Perform an inner join with the cities table on the left and the countries table on the right; do not alias tables here or in the next step.

SELECT * 
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;

Complete the SELECT statement to keep only the name of the city, the name of the country, and the region the country is located in (in the order specified).
Alias the name of the city AS city and the name of the country AS country.

SELECT cities.name AS city, countries.name AS country, countries.region 
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;


Perform an inner join of countries AS c (left) with populations AS p (right), on code.
Select name, year and fertility_rate.

SELECT name, year, fertility_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code;

Chain another inner join to your query with the economies table AS e, using code.
Select name, and using table aliases, select year and unemployment_rate from economies.

SELECT name, fertility_rate, e.year, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS E
ON c.code = e.code;

Modify your query so that you are joining to economies on year as well as code.

SELECT name, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code
	AND e.year = p.year;
