Begin by selecting all columns from the cities table, using the SQL shortcut that selects all.

SELECT * FROM cities;

Perform an inner join with the cities table on the left and the countries table on the right; do not alias tables here or in the next step.

SELECT * 
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;

Complete the SELECT statement to keep only the name of the city, the name of the country, and the region the country is located in (in the order specified).
Alias the name of the city AS city and the name of the country AS country.

SELECT cities.name AS city, countries.name AS country, countries.region 
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;
