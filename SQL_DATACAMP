Write SQL code that returns a result set with just one column listing the unique authors in the books table.

SELECT DISTINCT author FROM books;

Update the code to return the unique author and genre combinations in the books table.

SELECT DISTINCT author, genre FROM books;

Add an alias to the SQL query to rename the author column to unique_author in the result set.

SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author FROM books;

Add a single line of code that saves the results of the written query as a view called library_authors.

CREATE VIEW library_authors AS
SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author
FROM books;

Check that the view was created by selecting all columns from library_authors.

SELECT * FROM library_authors;
