1)Begin your query by selecting all fields from economies2015.
 Create a second query that selects all fields from economies2019.
 Perform a set operation to combine the two queries you just created, ensuring you do not return duplicates.

SELECT code, year FROM economies
UNION 
SELECT country_code, year FROM populations;

2)Perform an appropriate set operation that determines all pairs of country code and year (in that order) from economies and populations, excluding duplicates.
  Order by country code and year.
  
SELECT code, year FROM economies
UNION 
SELECT country_code, year FROM populations
 
2-A) Amend the query to return all combinations (including duplicates) of country code and year in the economies or the populations tables.
 
SELECT code, year
FROM economies
UNION ALL
SELECT country_code, year
FROM populations
ORDER BY code, year;

3)Return all city names that are also country names.

SELECT name FROM countries
INTERSECT 
SELECT name FROM cities

4)Return all cities that do not have the same name as a country.

SELECT name FROM cities
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM countries
ORDER BY name;
